This is a web-based application designed to facilitate farm management tasks for both administrators and farmers. The system allows administrators to organize farmers into folders based on regions or crops and enables farmers to upload images and data related to their farms.

### Features

#### Admin Interface:

1. **Dashboard:**
   - View summary of submissions.
   - Manage folders and assignments.

2. **Folder Management:**
   - Create, edit, and delete folders for different regions or crop types.
   - Assign farmers to specific folders based on region or crop type.

3. **User Management:**
   - View list of registered farmers.
   - Assign farmers to folders.

#### Farmer Interface:

1. **Registration/Login:**
   - Farmers can register with their details and log in to the platform.

2. **Profile Management:**
   - Update profile information, including region and crops grown.

3. **Submission Form:**
   - Upload images and input data related to crops.
   - Fields for crop type, region, date of submission, additional notes, and image upload.

4. **View Submissions:**
   - Farmers can view their previous submissions.
   - Filter submissions by region or crop type.

5. **Notifications:**
   - Receive notifications for new assignments or updates from the admin.

4. The app will support file uploads for images and possibly other relevant documents.
5. The interface will be user-friendly and intuitive for farmers with varying levels of technical proficiency.
6. Data storage will be secure and compliant with relevant regulations.
